Hooks iPhone app
yeah I don't even know what he's talking about... The iPhone has one of the best battery duration while being one of the thinnest phones, I don't see how that's a negative to anyone but the circlejerkers on Reddit.
Or they'll make an iPhone with [JUST headphone jacks](http://imgur.com/ohLKyMO)
Rubbish.

Two points:

1. Windows CE was seriously miles ahead of Apple when the iPhone dropped. To some degree it still is now. We were running 5,000 XDA handsets at one outfit across Europe, connected to Exchange, doing push messaging and device tracking, all sorts. This was in 2003, only 14 years ago. 

2. Holy hell the old iPhone UI was shit and still is in a lot of places (I have a 6s now). Nothing is discoverable, the contrast is all over the shop, all sorts and golly fucking gosh it doesn't just work. There isn't a week where something doesn't poke me in the eye. Just today, Apple Mail decided to show NOTHING in my Inbox for no apparent reason. I had to use Safari to hit the mailbox. Skeuomorphism has fortunately fucked off.

iPhone certainly doesn't dominate. Android does, and that's not necessarily a good thing. That's just horrible.
Not anymore. Not only is the RAM soldered to the boards now, the latest generation of Macbook Pro's have the SSD's soldered to the motherboards. I feel like a freaking idiot liking their OS and still wanting to buy upgrades to the hardware... I'm so proud not to have bought an iPhone 7. 
At least they could've gone USB-C for the iPhone and headphones so then it's a standard you could use anywhere (especially MacBooks).
Yup, and I lost a few hundred. I guess I really have only myself to blame for executing a market sell- but still

NAUH went up .18 to 2.40 and I had a few hundred shares at 1.40 and I decided to exit NAUH today for simple reasons of taking cash. I use Merrill Edge, the iPhone app, NASDAQ, and whathaveyou for live pricing. 

Like I said i guess I really only have myself to blame- I did a market sell assuming it would sell at market price (2.40) and it did not. It sold at fucking 2.20.

For me and portfolio size that is a lot of money. I called them and they said that APEX and RH sells at their prices. I but APEX pocket the rest. SO fucking scummy.
I love my iPhone 7 and iPad Pro. You're drinking your own coolaid buddy.
This business collapsed due to quality issues but before I had to stop selling I made around Â£20k profit in about 18 months. 

I imported Apple lightning cables from china, branded them and sold on Amazon using FBA. Profit margins of over 50% and sold for around Â£6 a go. Business ran itself and I had 2 brands of cables. Eventually the quality from China declined significantly and I couldn't find a better supplier. By that point the reviews were so bad on the product it would be hard to resuscitate. These days every man and his dog sells iPhone cables. 
At the moment only the iPhone app has the budgeting features, but they're coming to Android in the next few weeks or months.
